## Installation

```bash
pip install py-strapi
```

Or with uv (recommended for faster installs):

```bash
uv pip install py-strapi
```

For development:

```bash
# With pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# With uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

### Synchronous Usage

```python
from py_strapi import SyncClient, StrapiConfig

# Configure client
config = StrapiConfig(
    base_url="http://localhost:1337",
    api_token="your-api-token"
)

# Use client
with SyncClient(config) as client:
    # Get all articles
    response = client.get("articles")
    print(response)
```

### Asynchronous Usage

```python
import asyncio
from py_strapi import AsyncClient, StrapiConfig

async def main():
    config = StrapiConfig(
        base_url="http://localhost:1337",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    )

    async with AsyncClient(config) as client:
        response = await client.get("articles")
        print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be provided via environment variables with the `STRAPI_` prefix:

```bash
export STRAPI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1337"
export STRAPI_API_TOKEN="your-token"
export STRAPI_API_VERSION="auto"  # or "v4" or "v5"
export STRAPI_TIMEOUT=30
```

Or via code:

```python
from py_strapi import StrapiConfig

config = StrapiConfig(
    base_url="http://localhost:1337",
    api_token="your-token",
    api_version="auto",  # Automatic detection
    timeout=30.0,
    max_connections=10,
)
```

## Development

### Setup

# Install dependencies (uv is recommended for faster installs)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
# Or with pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Testing
